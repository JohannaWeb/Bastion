// Module for DOM (Document Object Model) tree representation
// RUST FUNDAMENTAL: Modules are Rust's basic namespace system.
// `mod dom;` tells the compiler that this crate has a `dom` module, and Rust will load it from `dom.rs` or `dom/mod.rs`.
mod dom;

// Module for CSS stylesheet parsing and cascade rules
// RUST FUNDAMENTAL: Every `mod` adds another node to the crate's module tree.
// Items inside that module are then named with paths like `css::Stylesheet` or `dom::Node`.
mod css;

// Module for fetching HTML and other resources from network
// RUST FUNDAMENTAL: Items are private by default in Rust, including module contents.
// You expose them outward with `pub`, and `pub use` can re-export names from one module through another path.
mod fetch;

// Module for font handling and glyph metrics
// RUST FUNDAMENTAL: Visibility in Rust is explicit and path-based.
// `pub` makes an item visible outside the defining module, while `pub(crate)` keeps it visible only within this crate.
mod font;

// Module for texture atlasing and glyph rendering
// RUST FUNDAMENTAL: A module declaration does not execute code by itself.
// It just tells the compiler to compile another source file into this crate under the `atlas` namespace.
mod atlas;

// Module for HTML parsing and tokenization
// RUST FUNDAMENTAL: Browser-style trees often need multiple parts of the program to hold references to the same node.
// This project solves that with `Rc<RefCell<_>>`, which combines shared ownership with runtime-checked mutation.
mod html;

// Module for layout tree generation from styled nodes
// RUST FUNDAMENTAL: Recursive data structures are common in Rust, but they usually store owned child collections
// instead of embedding values directly forever. Each level owns its children, which makes the tree finite and well-structured.
mod layout;

// Module for painting layout boxes to framebuffer
// RUST FUNDAMENTAL: Splitting code into many modules is the normal Rust style for medium-sized projects.
// It keeps each file focused and makes imports explicit at call sites.
mod paint;

// Module for styling DOM with CSS rules
// RUST FUNDAMENTAL: This kind of "walk one structure and build another structure" code is a common systems-programming pattern.
// It resembles a visitor in spirit, even though Rust typically expresses it with plain functions and enums rather than OOP hierarchies.
mod style;

// Module for legacy JavaScript engine (disabled)
// RUST FUNDAMENTAL: Attributes like `#[allow(dead_code)]` attach metadata or compiler directives to items.
// Here it suppresses the warning that would normally fire for code that is currently unused.
mod js;

// Module for Boa JavaScript runtime integration
// RUST FUNDAMENTAL: Integrating another runtime or library usually means crossing some API boundary.
// In Rust that broad idea is often described as FFI or embedding, even when the other component is also written in Rust.
mod js_boa;

// Module for GPU window rendering and display
// RUST FUNDAMENTAL: Cross-platform libraries often hide platform differences behind traits and concrete backend types.
// User code then works against the common API instead of directly targeting X11, Wayland, Cocoa, and so on.
mod window;

// Module for GPU painting capabilities (currently unused)
// RUST FUNDAMENTAL: Rust warns aggressively about unused code because it often signals a bug or dead branch.
// When a module is intentionally parked for future use, `#[allow(dead_code)]` documents that intent to the compiler.
#[allow(dead_code)]
mod gpu_paint;

// Import CSS stylesheet type for managing style rules

// After `use crate::html::Parser;`, code can write `Parser::new(...)` instead of the longer full path.

// Import layout tree for spatial box calculations
// RUST FUNDAMENTAL: Rust resolves names through module paths, and only public items can be reached from outside their module.
// `use` does not copy anything; it only gives the current scope a convenient binding to that path.

// `PathBuf` is the owned, mutable path type, roughly analogous to how `String` is the owned form of string data.

// Import Rc for reference counting shared data
// RUST FUNDAMENTAL: `Rc<T>` means "reference-counted pointer".
// Multiple parts of the program can own clones of the same pointer, and the value is dropped only when the last clone goes away.
// `Rc` uses non-atomic counting, so it is cheaper but limited to single-threaded code; `Arc<T>` is the thread-safe version.
use std::rc::Rc;

// Cargo resolves those names using `Cargo.toml`, downloads/builds the crates, and links them into this project.

        .install_default()
